# Tokki Learn - Exercise Screen Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a fully functional language learning exercise screen with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech Recognition capabilities for the Tokki Learn app.

## What Was Built

### 1. New Onboarding Exercise Screen (`OnboardingExerciseScreen.kt`)
- **Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/fouwaz/tokki_learn/onboarding/ui/OnboardingExerciseScreen.kt`
- **Features**:
  - Displays the exercise image (I'm sorry note)
  - Shows the target word "Perdón" (Spanish) with English translation "Sorry"
  - Three interactive buttons:
    - **Microphone**: Records user pronunciation
    - **Sound**: Plays TTS audio of the target word
    - **Like/Favorite**: Saves word for later review
  - Visual feedback during listening (animated dots and pulsing effect)
  - Pronunciation feedback dialog with accuracy score

### 2. TTS Manager (`TTSManager.kt`)
- **Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/fouwaz/tokki_learn/speech/TTSManager.kt`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Initializes Android's TextToSpeech engine
  - Supports multiple languages (Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, English)
  - Configurable speech rate (set to 0.7x for learning - slower than normal)
  - Tracks speaking state with Flow for reactive UI updates
  - Proper resource management (shutdown when done)

### 3. Speech Recognition Manager (`SpeechRecognitionManager.kt`)
- **Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/fouwaz/tokki_learn/speech/SpeechRecognitionManager.kt`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Uses Android's SpeechRecognizer API
  - Supports multiple language recognition (es-ES, fr-FR, de-DE, etc.)
  - Returns top 5 possible matches for accuracy
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Tracks listening state with Flow
  - Returns recognition results as sealed class (Success/Error)

### 4. Pronunciation Scoring System (`PronunciationScorer.kt`)
- **Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/fouwaz/tokki_learn/speech/PronunciationScorer.kt`
- **Algorithm**: Levenshtein distance for string similarity
- **Grading System**:
  - **Excellent**: 90-100% accuracy
  - **Good**: 75-89% accuracy
  - **Fair**: 60-74% accuracy
  - **Needs Practice**: Below 60%
- **Features**:
  - Calculates accuracy percentage
  - Provides feedback messages
  - Finds best match from multiple recognition results
  - Pass threshold set at 60%

### 5. Exercise ViewModel (`ExerciseViewModel.kt`)
- **Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/fouwaz/tokki_learn/onboarding/ExerciseViewModel.kt`
- **State Management**:
  - Manages TTS and Speech Recognition lifecycle
  - Tracks UI state (listening, speaking, favorited, etc.)
  - Handles pronunciation scoring automatically
  - Reactive state updates using Kotlin Flow
  - Proper cleanup in onCleared()

### 6. Navigation Updates
- Added new `OnboardingStep.Exercise` to the onboarding flow
- Updated `OnboardingViewModel` with exercise navigation logic
- Modified `MainActivity` to render the exercise screen
- Made Instagram icon clickable to navigate to exercise screen

### 7. Permissions
- Added `RECORD_AUDIO` permission to AndroidManifest.xml
- Implemented runtime permission request in the UI
- Graceful handling when permission is denied

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User completes the Instagram notification screen
2. Clicks on Instagram icon → navigates to Exercise screen
3. Sees "Perdón" (Spanish) with "Sorry" (English translation)
4. **Sound Button**: Taps to hear the word pronounced in Spanish
5. **Microphone Button**: Taps to record their pronunciation
   - Grants microphone permission if not already granted
   - Sees "Listening..." indicator
   - Speaks the word
   - Gets instant feedback with accuracy score
6. **Like Button**: Taps to favorite the word (changes color to red)
7. After successful pronunciation (≥60% accuracy), can continue to next screen

### Technical Flow:
1. **TTS Initialization**: On screen load, TTS engine initializes
2. **Sound Playback**: When sound button clicked:
   - ViewModel calls `TTSManager.speak("Perdón", "es")`
   - TTS speaks the word at 0.7x speed for clarity
3. **Speech Recognition**: When mic button clicked:
   - Requests microphone permission
   - Starts listening for speech in Spanish
   - Captures audio and converts to text
   - Returns top 5 possible matches
4. **Pronunciation Scoring**: After recognition:
   - Finds best match from recognition results
   - Calculates Levenshtein distance
   - Converts to percentage score
   - Assigns grade (Excellent/Good/Fair/Needs Practice)
   - Shows feedback dialog with score
5. **Favorite**: When like button clicked:
   - Toggles favorite state
   - Changes button color to indicate favorited

## Key Technologies Used
- **Kotlin**: Primary language
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI framework
- **Android TTS**: Built-in text-to-speech
- **Android SpeechRecognizer**: Built-in speech recognition
- **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**: Async/reactive programming
- **ViewModel & LiveData**: State management
- **Material3**: UI components

## Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModel handles business logic, UI observes state
- **Reactive UI**: Flow-based state updates
- **Single Source of Truth**: ViewModel manages all state
- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - TTS logic in TTSManager
  - Speech recognition in SpeechRecognitionManager
  - Scoring algorithm in PronunciationScorer
  - UI state in ExerciseViewModel
  - UI rendering in OnboardingExerciseScreen

## Future Enhancements (From Your Plan)

### Phase 4: Caching System (Not Yet Implemented)
- Build local database to store generated audio
- Cache top 500-1000 most frequently used words
- Pre-generate audio during app idle time
- Reduce latency by loading from cache

### Phase 5: Optimization (Not Yet Implemented)
- Add offline mode support
- Optimize audio quality per language
- Implement background audio handling
- Add haptic feedback
- Performance testing across devices

### Database Schema (Planned)
- `cached_audio` table: word, language, audio_file_path, created_at
- `exercise_content` table: exercise_id, word/phrase, translation, difficulty
- `pronunciation_history` table: user_id, word, accuracy_score, timestamp

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `OnboardingExerciseScreen.kt` - Exercise UI
2. `TTSManager.kt` - Text-to-Speech manager
3. `SpeechRecognitionManager.kt` - Speech recognition manager
4. `PronunciationScorer.kt` - Scoring algorithm
5. `ExerciseViewModel.kt` - Exercise state management

### Modified Files:
1. `OnboardingViewModel.kt` - Added Exercise step
2. `MainActivity.kt` - Added Exercise screen rendering
3. `OnboardingInstagramNotificationScreen.kt` - Made icon clickable
4. `AndroidManifest.xml` - Added RECORD_AUDIO permission

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test TTS with different languages
2. Test speech recognition accuracy with various pronunciations
3. Test permission flow (grant/deny)
4. Test error handling (no internet, TTS not available, etc.)
5. Test UI states (listening, speaking, favorited)
6. Test pronunciation scoring with edge cases
7. Test navigation flow through all onboarding screens

## Notes
- TTS works offline after initial setup
- Speech recognition requires internet connection
- Pronunciation scoring uses simple string similarity (could be enhanced with phonetic analysis in the future)
- Currently supports Spanish, but architecture allows easy addition of more languages
